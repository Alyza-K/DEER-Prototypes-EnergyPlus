# Templates

Templates is a library of *Params* templates for *EnergyPlus*. The library includes ready-to-use templates for space loads, zone HVAC equipment, central HVAC systems, and more. They are designed to be modular and completely reusable from project to project. They include parameters for many common energy-efficiency measures "pre-baked" into the templates. The template library encapsulates a significant body of knowledge with respect to best modeling practices in *EnergyPlus*.
